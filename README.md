## Configuration

### Custom Configuration

Place your custom configuration files in the `config/` directory. They will be included automatically.

Example `config/custom.conf`:
```conf
server:
    # Custom upstream forwarders
    forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 1.1.1.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 1.0.0.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-tls-upstream: yes
```

### Environment Variables

The image uses these defaults which can be overridden:

- `TZ`: Timezone (default: `America/Sao_Paulo`)

## Available Tags

- `latest`: Latest stable release
- `release-X.Y.Z`: Specific Unbound release version
- `dev`: Latest development build from main branch
- `main-YYYYMMDD-SHA`: Specific builds from main branch

## Build Schedule

The image is automatically rebuilt:
- Every 6 hours to check for new Unbound releases
- On every push to the main branch
- On manual workflow dispatch

## Architecture Support

Images are built for multiple architectures:
- `linux/amd64` (x86_64)
- `linux/arm64` (ARM 64-bit)

## Security Features

- DNSSEC validation enabled by default
- Runs as non-root user (`unbound`)
- Minimal base image (Debian slim)

- Health checks configured

## Volumes

- `/etc/unbound/conf.d`: Custom configuration files
- `/var/lib/unbound`: Unbound data directory

## Exposed Ports

- `53/udp`: DNS over UDP

## Health Check

The container includes a health check that runs:
```bash

# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Or using Docker directly
docker build -t unbound:local .
```
